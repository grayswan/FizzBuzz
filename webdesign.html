      <p class="offset" >Like pretty much everyone around in the 90's, I remember the early days
        of web design well: terrible graphics, ugly color combinations, and
        boring fonts. Back then, I didn't know any better. I was just happy to be
        exploring this cool new thing called the internet. By the time a page
        finally loaded, I didn't care what it looked like. I was just happy to be
        there.</p><br>

        <p class="offset">Thankfully, web design has reached new, beautiful heights, where form and
        function unite to produce easily navigable, visually rich websites.
        And as someone who is aesthetically-driven, I couldn't be happier
        to be coming into web development at this time.</p><br>

        <p class="offset">I've enjoyed watching web development change
        over the last few years. Mobile, in particular has come a long way, but I
        have also noticed great strides in other areas such as online retail. For
        example online retailer, <a href="http://www.bonlook.com/">Bonlook</a> allows
        the shopper to upload a picture and virtually try on a pair of glasses before
        buying them. And that's one of the directions I see the web heading: towards
        an increasingly interactive user experience.</p><br>
